# Marlin-2.1.2.1

My Marlin Tuning for Creality Ender 3 Max (original version)
Upgraded with Creality Sprite Pro direct drive extruder.
No auto-leveling! Moved runout sensor to top rail under spool holder.

Just making this available in case it helps others.
Please see the original Marlin documentation at https://marlin.org

This was not a direct pull from Marlin.
