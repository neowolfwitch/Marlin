# Marlin-2.1.2.1

My Marlin Tuning for Creality Ender 3 Max (original version, not NEO).
Upgraded with Creality Sprite Pro direct-drive all-metal extruder/hotend.
No auto-leveling, which the stock Creality Sprite firmware is built for.

* Manual (assisted) Leveling enabled.
* Max Temp now 300Â° for ABS.
* Adjusted PLA preheat temps.
* Changed ABS preheat to TPU.
* Adjusted motion settings (mm) for filament change.
* Adjusted runout sensor parameters for new mounting position on top rail.

Just making this available in case it helps others.
Please see the original Marlin documentation at https://marlin.org

(This was not a direct pull from the official Marlin repo.)
